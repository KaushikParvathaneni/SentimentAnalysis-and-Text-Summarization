2,2,1K3,4,it works as expected. I should have sprung for the higher capacity.  I think its made a bit cheesier than the earlier versions; the paint looks not as clean as before,2012-12-23,715,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12916666666666668,Neutral

5,5,2Cents!,5,It's mini storage.  It doesn't do anything else and it's not supposed to.  I purchased it to add additional storage to my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet which only come in 64 and 128 GB.  It does what it's supposed to and SanDisk has a long standing reputation that speaks for itself.,2013-04-29,588,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025,Neutral
6,6,2K1Toaster,5,I have it in my phone and it never skips a beat. File transfers are speedy and have not had any corruption issues or memory fade issues as I would expect from the Sandisk brand. Great card to own. Why entrust your precious files to a slightly cheaper piece of crap? If you lose everything can you forgive yourself for not spending the extra couple bucks on a trusted product that goes through good QA?,2013-10-19,415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2333333333333333,Neutral
